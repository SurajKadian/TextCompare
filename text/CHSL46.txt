Thar Desert is situated on the border of India and Pakistan. A large part of it is in Marwar region of Rajasthan state. This place receives very little rain and there are no large rivers flowing. As a result very few trees grow here and very few crops can be grown. Only grass grows here. People here mainly depend upon grazing sheep, goats and camels. They take great care to store rain water for drinking for the animals and human beings and also for some agriculture. The shepherds usually travel across many states with their herds and usually come back before the rainy season to Thar. They make a living by selling goats and wool of the sheep. Many traders coming from Iran and Afghanistan or going to those countries pass through this desert. They stop over at convenient places to rest. Slowly these places grew into important towns and cities like Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur. Many pilgrims going to Dwarka in Gujarat or to Mecca and Madina in Arabia or to Ajmer and Pushkar lake would pass through this area along with the traders. Thus over centuries people of many religions like Bohra Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Jains, Shaivas, Vaishnavas and Sikhs settled down in these towns and cities. Similarly, many Marwari traders from these parts went all over India and settled in several places. Some fifty years ago a large canal was built from the Punjab rivers to bring water to the Northern part of Thar desert. Along the canals came up new and prosperous villages many people from Punjab and Haryana came and settled down in these new villages. Earlier people mainly ate rotis made of bajra with green gram or black gram and ate of vegetables that grew on some trees (Sangri) and thorny bushes. These were dried and eaten throughout the year.
