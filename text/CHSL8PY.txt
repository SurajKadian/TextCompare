Online Advertising is the art of using the internet, as a medium to deliver marketing messages to an identified and intended audience. It is helpful for attracting website traffic and bran exposure, but first and foremost, online advertising is designed to persuade the targeted customer to engage in a specific action like making a purchase. There are many different types of online advertising mediums. Some of them are content marketing and social media marketing. Once you have established a clear social media marketing strategy, you can start to consider advertising on social media platforms. Most social media sites now easily allow advertisers to utilize their reach and promote their products from within the platform. They also include good analytics tools to assess the success of the investment made. This might include a promoted tweet or post, a promotion of user generated content or even an entire campaign that is released across multiple social channels. Content Marketing is another great way to get a brand and message in front of the right people. Its primary focus is to attract organic traffic to a website by improving the SEO of a site, but once you have the strategy and content in place, you can increase its reach and engagements by paying for the content to feature on appropriate websites. Paid advertising can help to increase the ROI of content marketing. That means, without promotion, the production costs can often outweigh the potential return. Native advertising, a form of paid media, is a clever way of creating an ad that follows the theme of the site where it is placed. It is intentionally designed to look like the media where it appears and is sometimes referred to as an advertorial or sponsored content.
