'There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so'. William Shakespeare, the magnificent observer of human behaviour and nature, discovered the key to destiny of mankind as well as this world, and artistically presented it for the coming generation in his specific creation Hamlet. If we think and observe even our own activities and their results - good and bad, successful and unsuccessful, well and woe till now, we will discover that everything happened and are happening on the basis of our decision and perception. Our thinking process has two opposites: one that ushers in healthy and favourable outputs is known as positive or good which always keeps us active and encourages us stoutly and confidently undertake one after another action or adventure, while the other results in unhealthy and vulnerable outputs that jeopardise our lives is known as bad or negative. 
Our positive thoughts and decisions, the output of our thinking, always lead us to growth and improvement while the negative lead us to perils and dangers. This power makes us decide the good and bad based on the human values we own. Our conscience, awareness, knowledge, experience, love, hatred, and other qualities influence us greatly in course of deciding the status of anything. It is natural or God gifted. Only human beings avail this opportunity out of the six senses that God has given all living beings in this planet. We have won the dominant position on this planet by the command of our thinking that has helped us develop our science and technology over time. Shakespeare was once asked to elaborate the above extract. He replied intelligently, A man cheerfully observed a religious fast seven days a week. His neighbour starved to death on the same diet.
