  '2': "Tourism has emerged as the world's largest industry. Growing rapidly in the last two decades, today it accounts for six per cent of world output and employs some Hundred million people around the globe. Since the end of the Second World War, it has developed immense revenue and development potential and stands today as a unique natural renewable resource industry. Tourism-the travel based recreation provides people with a change of place and a break from the monotony of daily life. It brings peoples of different nations together, allowing them to come into close contact with each other's customs and other aspects of life. It reveals the scenic beauty and past heritage of a country to people belonging to other nations. The knowledge and experience gained in the process can lead to greater understanding and tolerance, and can even foster world peace. The contribution of tourism can be nowhere seen more clearly than on the economic front. A study conducted by the United Nations has shown that developing countries, in particular, can reap handsome benefits out of tourism which greatly boosts national income. Tourism generates employment, and adds to the entrepreneurial wealth of a nation. While tourismâ€™s advantages are many, its undesirable side-effects have raised fresh problems. Tourism can cause social, cultural or environmental disruption. Of the greatest concern is its damage to the environment. In order to attract more tourists, sprawling resorts are built which take neither the local architectural styles nor the ecology into consideration. Natural system come to be destroyed as a result of indiscriminate construction to provide water and waste disposal facilities and recreational arrangements to tourists. Overuse of environmental wealth disturbs the ecological balance. Damage is most in wildlife parks which remain the foremost sites of tourists attraction. Tourist vans and the visitors' feet the ground vegetation, thus affecting the feeding habits of the animals and the landscape as well. ",
  '3': "Today, group life faces several challenges due to the development of technology and materialistic outlook. Many, though live among thousands yet feel alone. Values of happy life such as love, affection, empathy, friendliness etc. are becoming rare commodity today. Social group work, that is based on these values may be of a great help to the modern man. Urbanization has increased the problem of isolation and separation. The feeling of separation is gradually increasing. Many are considering themselves as helpless and are limited to their close circles. Thus its result may be seen in the form of increased mental tension. Social group work attempts to deal with the problem of isolation. Every human being has the basic desire of having importance, worth, respect and a place in the society. Social group work keeps the members busy by providing them worth, dignity, place, role, and creative participation. Modern age affects our adaptation abilities. Old techniques are not as suitable as those were in the past. Man has to learn new techniques of behaviour for the proper adjustment and survival in the various fields of life. Social group work provides this knowledge. Social group work provides a new hope to the physically challenged, differently abled, aged, alcoholics and the chronicically ill. Social group work helps to achieve democratic goals such as liberty, equality, fraternity and social justice. It provides recreation, the most valuable medicine for keeping oneself mentally healthy. Human capacities and abilities are strengthened through the group work. Social group work helps in solving psychological problems. It is evident that no individual can resist the influence of group life on them. The modern day studies reveal the importance of group experience on personality development. Hence in social group work, the method of social work treats group as a client and makes use of group experience as a means to realize social work goals. It can be effectively used for promotive, preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative purposes.",

There is no particular age limit to learn something new, we can keep learning till end and keep earning the knowledge. We learn something to get the knowledge out of it and not to boost the ego to show superiority in front of others. Respect the knowledge, it will take you to a level ahead in your life. Never limit yourself with what you have, the more you discuss the more you earn. This will only help you to get more and more about different things. You are always surrounded by a group of people, friends or whatsoever, they may or may not be of same educational background or traditional or work as of you, they will be aware of something that you may not know or you may have something good to share which they think might help and this is possible is you start a conversation and discuss amongst yourself. This will make everyone share what they know and also learn new things at the same time. Elderly are always treated as people of high knowledge or wise people even though they don't acquire a degree and the reason is the experience and knowledge about most of the things they have come through their life, our own parents will have so much to share about different things which they used to see in a different way as compared to that of the world it sees now. Discussing with them will help us learn something new, it may be your own tradition or way of living, the art of living and so on, start now. Ratan was not anxious to give up the freedom he found in America, but he did want to get out of the cold, which he never did get used to, complaining that he couldn't ever feel warm enough. Vowing that he would never live in a cold climate again, he left Ithaca as soon as his coursework was completed, but instead of returning to India, he headed out to Los Angeles, where he moved to an apartment complex, complete with swimming pool. He intended to use his architecture degree to get a job in the area and, eventually.",
  '5': 'Money stashed abroad is not always the money, which has been evaded from payment of taxes. Drug lords, terrorists groups, gangsters all over the world, along with International Syndicates also keep their money in safe havens, where they can lay their hands on it in times of need for their operational purposes. There is no mechanism with the Government to determine and say with cent per cent surety that the money hoarded abroad is only the one that has been evaded from payment of taxes and not the other crime linked cash. The Revenue Department and other agencies of the Government like the RAW and State Trading Organisations have their offices abroad. There is no common mandate to them to report any suspicious transactions by the Indians either visiting or staying abroad. The stark truth is that the black money is result of high level corruption prevailing in our country. The schemes meant for the poor, even as per the Government reports, are not implemented and the money siphoned off. Even laws permit every criminal whether in jail or on bail to hide their names and crimes and create false alibis. But, here the Government is creating alibis for those people whose names have been received and disclosed as the persons who are having cash, which is got illegally and is not from any known legal sources. They had stashed this cash in safe tax havens abroad. Even the Supreme Court, the Apex Court of India, says that nothing moves without bribery in India.A good and alert cop even on a tourist visa can spot Indians roaming about and visiting these safe tax havens or Swiss banks. The rest of the job of tracing the flight of black money from India can be done locally provided the Government has the will. So far, the Government has been making. ',
  '6': 'Scientific social work today has emerged as a problem solving profession. Compared to other disciplines, professional social work is relatively young. This profession helps individuals, groups and communities to find solutions for their problems. Finding solutions to problems enhances the quality of life and fosters development. Problems at any level (individual or social) can affect the interactions and relationships of individuals. Thus, the social adjustment and functioning get affected. Hence, social work intervention in solving problems promotes social functioning of individuals. Social work, over years has evolved a scientific knowledge base, clear skill sets and a strong value system, unique to the profession. Field level experience and research in addressing the problems of various client groups have resulted in developing different strategies and methods. These methods differ in their application of knowledge, skills, and techniques. The methods of social work are social case work, social group work, community organization, social action, social welfare administration, and social work research. They are broadly classified as primary and secondary methods. Case work, group work, and community organization which require direct interaction with the client are called the primary or direct methods. The other three, for which face to face contact with the client is not essential, are termed as secondary or indirect methods. In this unit, let us discuss the primary methods in detail.

  '7': 'Thar Desert is situated on the border of India and Pakistan. A large part of it is in Marwar region of Rajasthan state. This place receives very little rain and there are no large rivers flowing. As a result very few trees grow here and very few crops can be grown. Only grass grows here. People here mainly depend upon grazing sheep, goats and camels. They take great care to store rain water for drinking for the animals and human beings and also for some agriculture. The shepherds usually travel across many states with their herds and usually come back before the rainy season to Thar. They make a living by selling goats and wool of the sheep. Many traders coming from Iran and Afghanistan or going to those countries pass through this desert. They stop over at convenient places to rest. Slowly these places grew into important towns and cities like Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur. Many pilgrims going to Dwarka in Gujarat or to Mecca and Madina in Arabia or to Ajmer and Pushkar lake would pass through this area along with the traders. Thus over centuries people of many religions like Bohra Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Jains, Shaivas, Vaishnavas and Sikhs settled down in these towns and cities. Similarly, many Marwari traders from these parts went all over India and settled in several places. Some fifty years ago a large canal was built from the Punjab rivers to bring water to the Northern part of Thar desert. Along the canals came up new and prosperous villages many people from Punjab and Haryana came and settled down in these new villages. Earlier people mainly ate rotis made of bajra with green gram or black gram and ate of vegetables that grew on some trees (Sangri) and thorny bushes. These were dried and eaten throughout the year.

  '8': 'There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. William Shakespeare, the magnificent observer of human behaviour and nature, discovered the key to destiny of mankind as well as this world, and artistically presented it for the coming generation in his specific creation Hamlet. If we think and observe even our own activities and their results - good and bad, successful and unsuccessful, well and woe till now, we will discover that everything happened and are happening on the basis of our decision and perception. Our thinking process has two opposites: one that ushers in healthy and favourable outputs is known as positive or good which always keeps us active and encourages us stoutly and confidently undertake one after another action or adventure, while the other results in unhealthy and vulnerable outputs that jeopardise our lives is known as bad or negative.Our positive thoughts and decisions, the output of our thinking, always lead us to growth and improvement while the negative lead us to perils and dangers. This power makes us decide the good and bad based on the human values we own. Our conscience, awareness, knowledge, experience, love, hatred, and other qualities influence us greatly in course of deciding the status of anything. It is natural or God gifted. Only human beings avail this opportunity out of the six senses that God has given all living beings in this planet. We have won the dominant position on this planet by the command of our thinking that has helped us develop our science and technology over time. Shakespeare was once asked to elaborate the above extract. He replied intelligently, A man cheerfully observed a religious fast seven days a week. His neighbour starved to death on the same diet.',

Without proper leadership, organizations move slowly, stagnate, and lose their way. The absence or failure of leadership may lead to ineffective decision making. A social worker can't perform effectively without leadership skills. Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.

According to John Newstrom and Keith Davis leadership is the process of influencing and supporting others to work enthusiastically towards achieving objectives. It is a process whereby one individual influences other group members toward the attainment of defined group or organizational goals. Leaders set a direction for the rest of the people; they help others see what lies ahead; visualize what to achieve; encourage and inspire others. Leadership is the ability to get other people to do something significant and energize people towards a goal. It influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.
